### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a developer from Brazil. Passionate for programming, _Linux_, problem solving and âœ¨ _learning_ âœ¨.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some hobby projects and collaborating to some public, open-source repositories.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C# and improving on JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm very interested on Linux and I'm all the time taking a look at [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd love being be able to collaborate to the [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), but I'm still far from that.
- âš¡ Random fact: I'm an official translator for Steam and for other projects.
