### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a developer from Brazil. Passionate for programming, _Linux_, problem solving and âœ¨ _learning_ âœ¨.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some hobby projects and collaborating to some public, open-source repositories.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, improving on JavaScript and starting a new journey on Mobile Development learning Flutter.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm very interested on Linux and I'm all the time taking a look at [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), which I'd love to collaborate to, but I still need to learn a lot.
- âš¡ Random fact: I'm an official translator for Steam and for other projects.
